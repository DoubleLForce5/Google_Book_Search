## Usage instructions
On page load, the user will be presented with a search bar where they can enter a book name, author, or topic to search Google Books for. Items relating to that search will then populate the page. Upon completion of their search the user can decide to either view more info about a particular book on the Google Books site or save the book to the 'saved' page for reference later. 

If and when the user decides they are no longer interested in a certain book they can choose to delete that book from their page by clicking the remove button.
